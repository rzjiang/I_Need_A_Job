The PathNormalizer.java file uses regular expressions to normalize paths from standard input.
The .java file contains the code along with a few comments about how the program works.

To run the program, you can run the .class file and type in a path of your choosing without any quotation marks.
For instance: If I were running from a terminal, I would type in verbatim:
	java PathNormalizer
	foo/./bar
After the second line is executed, the program will print an output and immediately exit, so if you want to normalize another string,
then you must run the program again followed by the path you want to normalize. 
If you want you can compile the PathNormalizer.java file before running PathNormalizer:
	javac PathNormalizer.java
but I promise you the .java file and the .class file are exactly the same.
